The token design itself is flawed: there's no origin binding to prevent cross-origin replay, no action binding so the same token works for anything, and the entire nonce roundtrips as base64-JSON which is inefficient. The bot score is● completely broken since the client sets it directly—the server should compute the score from raw signals instead of trusting what the client sends. The auto-generated secret that changes on restart means all outstanding tokens become●  invalid, and in a clustered setup different workers get different secrets entirely. I also need to add challenge proof validation and fix the JSON parsing to prevent prototype pollution.AC

For the redesign, I'm moving to server-side score computation from behavioral signals, using AES-256-GCM with HMAC
for authenticated encryption, and binding tokens to origin, Host, IP prefix, and UA hash so they can't be replayed
across different contexts. I'll use Redis as the backing store for nonce state instead of in-memory storage.
⎿  ◻ Rewrite backend smartHumanCheckService with v2 envelope
On the frontend, I'm leveraging WebCrypto for HMAC operations with per-session keys, adding proof-of-work challenges for high-risk requests, collecting richer entropy signals, and switching to raw signal submission instead of trusting client-computed scores. The overall approach treats the client as untrusted and validates everything server-side.
Given the scope of changes across multiple files and the high effort setting, I should present a concrete
implementation plan to the user for approval before diving in—this touches the core service, nonce storage,
controllers, and routes, so getting alignment on the approach first makes sense.─────────────────────────────────────

∴ I'm mapping out a comprehensive redesign strategy for Cloudflare-grade security, starting with task planning and
getting user approval before implementation. Since they've set effort to high, I need to be thorough about the core
principles—particularly that the server must be the authoritative source for validation and tokens should remain
opaque and encrypted.

Now I'm detailing the concrete backend changes: I'll redesign the token format using AES-256-GCM encryption for both
nonces and tokens, derive keys via HKDF for different purposes, and bind tokens to origin, IP class, user agent, and
action to prevent cross-site reuse. The server will compute the security score from raw signals rather than trusting
client input, and I'll add HMAC-SHA256 authentication...

Still writing backend implementation...

For the frontend, I'm removing the client-computed score field and instead having it submit raw signals only, then
add WebCrypto signing with an ephemeral session key and optional proof-of-work validation. The nonce returned by the
server will derive a shared secret that binds to the token, and I'll compute an HMAC over the canonical payload using
the HKDF-derived key. Finally, I'll update the test suite to cover the new token binding logic and server-side score
write out a comprehensive implementation plan, get user approval on scope, then execute it systematically.

Actually, the user has already given me clear authorization with "必要时重写" (rewrite if necessary) and the /effort high flag, so they've essentially pre-approved the scope. I should create tasks to track the major work items and
start implementing. The critical issues I'm seeing are that the client-computed score is being trusted, which
violates Cloudflare security principles—I need to move all sensitive validation server-side.

The plan is straightforward: rewrite the service with proper token versioning and server-side validation, add Redis
support to the nonce store, tighten the controller and routes with proper origin binding, update the client component to submit raw signals instead of computed scores, and then update tests and commit everything. Let me start by
setting up task tracking and diving into the backend service rewrite.

⎿  · v2 重写会改变 token 结构（不再是明文 JSON 的 base64，而是 AES-GCM+HMAC
的不透明二进制），且服务端权威评分（忽略客户端 sc）。这是破坏性变更，是否同意？ → 硬切换 v2（推荐）
· master 密钥落地方式？ → 必须显式 env，否则启动失败

∴ I'm deciding between a hard migration to v2 or making the environment variable mandatory with startup validation.
Going with the hard cutover approach simplifies the implementation. Now I'm laying out the v2 service architecture,
starting with the cryptographic foundation using a master secret from the environment that needs to be at least 32
bytes.

I'm using HKDF-SHA256 to derive separate encryption keys for the nonce and token envelopes, both using AES-256-GCM.
But I'm reconsidering the token flow—the client shouldn't be encrypting anything. Instead, the frontend computes an
HMAC over the behavioral payload and sends it back to the server, which can then encrypt it internally for storage.

Let me trace through the actual data flow: the frontend requests a nonce from the backend, which returns an encrypted
nonce blob plus an HMAC key seed. The frontend collects behavioral data, derives an HMAC key from that seed, and
computes a tag over the canonical payload. When submitting the verification request, it sends the nonce, payload, and
HMAC tag back to the server. The server decrypts the nonce to extract the metadata and key seed, recomputes the HMAC
to validate the payload, scores the behavior, and returns a verdict. The shared key for the HMAC is randomly
generated by the server, embedded in the encrypted nonce, and also returned to the client separately so it can
compute the tag—then the server extracts it again during decryption to validate.

The nonce response includes the opaque encrypted nonce, the ephemeral HMAC key in base64, expiration timestamp, the
bound action, and proof-of-work difficulty. The token submission contains the nonce, canonical JSON payload, and HMAC
tag. The server decrypts the nonce to recover the ephemeral key and bindings, verifies the HMAC matches, checks that
the bindings align with the request context, and scores the behavioral signals server-side without any
client-provided score.

Defining the token envelope v2 format...

The nonce envelope stores the nonce ID, ephemeral key, action, host binding, IP class hash, user agent hash, issued
and expiration timestamps, and optional proof-of-work parameters. The nonceStore tracks each nonce ID to enforce
single-use consumption and prevent replays.

For the master key initialization, I'm making it strict: the environment variable must be set or the process fails at
startup, with a carveout only for test mode or when an explicit secret is passed in options.

Defining the envelope structure... Finishing the decryption logic...

Now I'm thinking through the key derivation strategy—I'll derive sub-keys from the master key using HKDF with
different info strings for nonce encryption, token encryption, and binding HMAC. Actually, since the client receives
an ephemeral key directly in the nonce response, I don't need a separate persistent HMAC key; the ephemeral key
handles the binding. For the master key itself, I'll keep it simple: always derive from the UTF-8 representation of
the secret using HKDF to get a consistent 32-byte key.

For the nonce issuance flow, I'm collecting the client's IP, user agent, and origin, then generating a random nonce
ID and ephemeral key. I'll bundle these into a nonce record that includes hashes of the IP class, user agent, and
host, along with timestamps for issuance and expiration, plus optional proof-of-work parameters.

The AAD binds the encrypted envelope to the action and host, then I encrypt the whole record with the nonce
encryption key and store it server-side before returning the opaque nonce string, ephemeral key, and expiration to
the client.

For verification, I decrypt the nonce to extract its contents, validate that the action and host match what's
expected, check the IP class and user agent hashes, verify expiration, and atomically mark the nonce as consumed.
Then I recompute the HMAC using the ephemeral key and the canonical serialization of the payload, compare it
constant-time with what the client provided, and verify any proof-of-work. Finally, I run server-side scoring on the
behavior signals and apply a dynamic threshold based on IP and user agent risk profiles.

I need to ensure both client and server use the same deterministic JSON serialization with sorted keys for the
payload, and I should be careful about binding the origin using the Host header from the request.

For the nonce consumption, an in-memory check-then-set works fine for single-process deployments, though I can add a
Redis backend later if needed. The key insight is that each nonce gets a fresh ephemeral key, so the token is
inherently tied to that specific nonce.

Now I'm moving the client-side scoring logic to run server-side instead...

the existing service already has assessRisk that evaluates raw signals, but it's currently trusting the client's
submitted score. I need to flip that—compute the score server-side from the raw signals and ignore whatever the
client sends.

I'm planning to organize this as a single service file for now to minimize disruption, keeping the existing getStats
and cleanupExpiredNonces exports that the controller and tests depend on. The main pieces are handling nonce issuance
with metadata bindings, server-authoritative scoring from behavioral signals, and the crypto envelope for request
verification.

Let me start writing the service...

Actually, I should think through what signals Cloudflare provides and what I can add server-side. The client sends
things like session continuity, TLS fingerprints if available, browser detection signals, and hardware metrics. On
the server I can validate Accept-Language consistency and client hints. I'll also add optional proof-of-work—a
Hashcash-style challenge where the client finds a nonce matching a difficulty threshold, which is great for
rate-limiting automated attacks.

Writing the service now with the crypto helpers, canonical JSON serialization, and the scoring logic all in place.

I'm settling on a clean API: issueNonce(ctx) and verifyToken(token, ctx) where context includes IP, user agent, host,
action, and optional difficulty. The controller and tests will need updates to match, but that's straightforward.

Writing the service implementation...

                                                                                       09:28 PM claude-opus-4-7

● Hard cutover to v2, mandatory env secret. Let me start building. First I'll begin the in-progress task and write the
new backend service.

● Now I'll write the rewritten backend service. The new design uses AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption with
HKDF-derived per-purpose keys, server-authoritative behavioral scoring, and binds tokens to
action+origin+IP-class+UA-hash with atomic single-use nonces.
